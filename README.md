# :money_with_wings: Airbnb Rio de Janeiro Price Prediction :money_with_wings:

## Context

 - On Airbnb, anyone who has a room or any type of property (apartment, house, chalet, inn, etc.) can offer their property to be rented by the day.

 - You create your host profile (a person who makes a property available for daily rental) and create the listing for your property.

 - In this listing, the host must describe the property's characteristics as completely as possible to help renters/travelers choose the best property for them (and to make the listing more attractive).

- There are dozens of possible customizations for your listing, from the minimum number of nights, price, number of rooms, to cancellation rules, extra fees for additional guests, requirement for renter identity verification, etc.

 - This is a data science project developed as a part of Hashtag Trainamentos course and the application of the knowledge I've acquired so far. As a junior developer, I am open to suggestions to improve upon it. 

## Objective

 - Build a price prediction model that allows an average person who owns a property to know how much they should expect to spend when renting.

## About the files in this repository

 - As it was developed as part of a course and the learnings obtained the Jupyter Notebook file "Airbnb_Rio" has all the analysis made during the construction of the code and the reasons why such decisions were made.

 - The final solution is in the Python file "Airbnb_Rio_PricePrediction" without all analysis and with a cleaner code to understand the machine learning model features




## ReferÃªncia

-  The databases were taken from the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/allanbruno/airbnb-rio-de-janeiro

 - If you want another solution, you can look at the solution by Kaggle user Allan Bruno in the Notebook: (https://www.kaggle.com/allanbruno/helping-regular-people-price-listings-on-airbnb) which was used as an inspiration for this project.

 - You will notice similarities between the solution developed here and his, but also some significant differences in the project construction process as we have different objectives.
